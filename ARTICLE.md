In software development, projects often involve multiple dependencies, making the use of virtual environments essential. This approach isolates a project’s dependencies, avoiding conflicts between packages and versions while ensuring a reproducible environment for all developers and deployment setups.

A virtual environment acts as an independent space where project-specific dependencies are installed. This prevents interference with globally installed libraries and other projects. Additionally, it improves project portability by ensuring that all developers work under the same conditions.

The virtualenv tool has historically been the standard for creating virtual environments in Python. While functional and widely adopted, it has limitations. Using it often requires additional commands for creation, activation, and dependency management, increasing the risk of errors and maintenance issues in complex projects.

Poetry is a modern tool for dependency and virtual environment management in Python. Unlike virtualenv, Poetry offers a smoother and more convenient experience by combining virtual environment creation, dependency management, and script handling into a single workflow.

## **Advantages of Poetry**

- Integrated Management: Poetry handles not only the virtual environment but also project dependencies through a pyproject.toml file.
- Simple Commands: With intuitive commands, it allows for installing dependencies, locking versions, and running scripts easily.
- Portability: Poetry ensures consistency across environments by including a poetry.lock file.
- Seamless Usage: It automatically integrates with virtual environments, removing the need for manual activation steps.

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a powerful tool that enables defining cloud infrastructure using programming languages (infrastructure as code). When initializing a project for use with CDK using the “cdk init” command, a virtual environment is automatically created using virtualenv. However, we aim to integrate CDK with Poetry instead of virtualenv.

The default use of virtualenv during CDK initialization with the “cdk init” command can cause the following issues when combined with Poetry for managing virtual environments:

- Incorrect Deactivation: If virtualenv is not properly deactivated before using another tool like Poetry, it can lead to permission and package version issues.
- Duplicate Dependencies: The lack of synchronization between the virtualenv environment and the one managed by Poetry can result in inconsistencies.

To avoid such issues, we should:

- Check if the virtual environment created by virtualenv has been activated, and deactivate it properly if necessary.
- Initialize Poetry within our project.
- Manually add AWS dependencies.

## **An Alternative Approach: The cdk_poetry_init.py Script**

An alternative approach would be initializing CDK projects using a custom script, [cdk_poetry_init.py](https://github.com/restevean/cdk_poetry_init.git). This script, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/restevean/cdk_poetry_init.git), automates the initialization of a CDK project with Poetry. It achieves the same results as the “cdk init” command but manages the virtual environment with Poetry instead of virtualenv.

## **Features of the Script**

1. Ease of use.

2. No need to check and deactivate a virtualenv-created environment, as the script does not rely on it.

3. Custom initialization: Creates a virtual environment managed by Poetry.

4. Dependency configuration: Automatically installs the required dependencies for a CDK project.

## **Usage Example**

1. Clone the script repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/restevean/cdk_poetry_init.git
```

2. Copy the `cdk_poetry_init.py` script to your project directory:

```
cp cdk_poetry_init/cdk_poetry_init.py /path/to/your/project/
```

3. Change the script permissions to make it executable:

```
chmod +x /path/to/your/project/cdk_poetry_init.py
```

4. Run the script in your project directory:

```
cd /path/to/your/project/
./cdk_poetry_init.py
```

5. Remember to activate your Poetry virtual environment with the following command:

```
poetry shell
```

## **Conclusion**

Integrating AWS CDK with Poetry not only simplifies the workflow but also reduces the risk of errors. As of now, AWS does not provide a streamlined method for this integration. The “cdk_poetry_init.py” script demonstrates how to combine the benefits of both tools to create a more robust and efficient development environment. If you are looking for a modern and frictionless way to manage CDK projects, this solution is worth exploring.
